PLUGIN_EXPORT void notify(void* data, char* param_name)
    This method will be called then some parameters of function
    changed. During loading file is not called for each parameter
    updated from project file - it called once after whole paramters
    setted with param_name==NULL.
    So, if param_name is NULL - it's first notify after projects loads,
    On next notifies its called with defined parameter.....
